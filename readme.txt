             This is DVRFlash release 1.1 by Agent Smith


- General Notes:

This utility will allow you to flash a Pioneer DVR drive (or compatible)
with a relevant firmware, and to escape the various restrictions set by
Pioneer with their UPGDVD flashing tools.

The following versions of DVRFlash are provided:
o Windows version
o DOS/DPMI version
o Linux/x86 version
Please read the readme file for the relevant version


- Usage:

The basic usage of DVRFlash is:

  DVRFlash [flags] [device] [firmware file(s)]

Please make sure that the firmware files are in the current directory.


- Technical information:

DVRFlash is completely based on Pat LaVarre's PLScsi, so if you don't
understand what device name you should use and how it's all supposed to
work, have a look at the PLScsi's documentation on:
  http://members.aol.com/plscsi/

Unfortunately, PLScsi does not support Mac (yet), so no version of the DVR
Flasher is available for that platform. 
There is hope in sight though, so please keep supporting Pat's outstanding
work and whoever is helping him to crack the OS-X SCSI passthrough ;)


- Thanks to:
