 o DVR-K12 support
 o Added mandatory commandline report in the output
Fixes:
 o Uppercase Windows drive letter fix for the clueless user
 o Improper 'OEM' wording has been removed
 o 103 support is permanetly removed - not worth the trouble

Known Bugs:
 o Microsoft apparently broke passthru access with Windows 2003

   platforms. This looks like a PLScsi problem, not a DVRFlash one
